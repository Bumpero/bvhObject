# Collision-Aware 3D System

A TypeScript-based library for simulating 3D objects with collision detection and tracking using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH).

## Features
- Collision-aware 3D objects with movement and collision history.
- BVH-based spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection.
- Utility methods for querying object state and history.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
